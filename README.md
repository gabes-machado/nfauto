## <p align='center'> PROJECT DEVELOPMENT
## Problem:

Every month brazilian accountants need to apurate tax reports, based on the revenue of their clients. Each client need to send their fiscal receipts by the 15th of each month to their accountants.

More often than not, this dynamic don't occur, and accountants need to get the fiscal receipts themselves, on their local federal treasury website.

## Solution:

The proposed solution, is to create an automation script to catch fiscal receipts of clients based on Distrito Federal, on the Agenci@Net website.

This Software is aimed to all Distrito Federal accountants.
